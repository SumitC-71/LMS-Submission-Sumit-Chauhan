----------------- Case Study Questions -----------------

----------------- A. Pizza Metrics -----------------
-- How many pizzas were ordered?

-- How many unique customer orders were made?
-- How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
-- How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
-- How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
-- What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
-- For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
-- How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
-- What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
-- What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

----------------- B. Runner and Customer Experience -----------------
-- How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
-- What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
-- Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
-- What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
-- What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
-- What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
-- What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

----------------- C. Ingredient Optimisation -----------------
-- What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
-- What was the most commonly added extra?
-- What was the most common exclusion?
-- Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
-- Meat Lovers
-- Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
-- Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
-- Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
-- Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
-- For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
-- What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

----------------- D. Pricing and Ratings -----------------
-- If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
-- What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
-- Add cheese is $1 extra
-- The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
-- Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
-- customer_id
-- order_id
-- runner_id
-- rating
-- order_time
-- pickup_time
-- Time between order and pickup
-- Delivery duration
-- Average speed
-- Total number of pizzas
-- If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
